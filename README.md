# CourtCounter
Rugby Score Tracker

This is one of the projects to be completed on Android Basics track of Google Africa Challenge Scholarship.

Apart from the court counter app discussed in the class, this one takes the functionality further by adding to it :
*** Toast messages that displays the game has ended upon click on reset button
*** The winner is determined and displays a toast message notifying of the winning team.
